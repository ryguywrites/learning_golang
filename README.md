You can download the xkcd comic data online and generate indices with the commang "go run xkcd.go build".

To search using the indices, "go run xkcd.go search". Search allows you to filter through 4 keys: num (the comic number), month (the month it was published), year (the year it was published) and title (the title of the comic). Searching is case sensitive, and you can filter with the following inequalities: "<=". ">=", and "=". 

If you download all the files in this directory, then there's no need to run "go run xkcd.go build".
